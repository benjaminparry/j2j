# Introduction to "jQuery to JavaScript"

The purpose of this is to provide native JavaScript code for some of the most common (at some point, all) jQuery functions.  
You'll also find references to official documentation (namely on [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)) and helpful Polyfill when needed ([what are polyfills?](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill)).

All native JavaScript code should work on Internet Explorer 8 and upwards (and if not, a polyfill or IE 8 specific code should be provided).

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by raising an issue on the [Github repo](https://github.com/AidanThreadgold/j2j) or opening a pull request!  
You can find a list of functions [yet to be documented here](http://aidan.io/j2j/dev/todos.html), but don't hesitate to provide better code examples.
